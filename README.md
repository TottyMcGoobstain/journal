Had to focus on a couple of my businesses last month and got derailed from my coding focus...back in the saddle now for a bit...it's amazing how quick habits can change if your not on top of it. In hindsight, should have at least tried to code 30 mins a day just to stay fresh...no my brains kinda of rusty.
